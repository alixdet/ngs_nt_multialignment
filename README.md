## General info
This project has been developped during an internship at the Pasteur Institute in French Guiana, at the Laboratory of Virus-Host Interactions.

Its aim is to get a multi-alignement in nucleotids from a multi-alignement in amino acids allowing 
better phylogenetic studies. 

The purpose of the code here is not to be used as is but to be integreted in a larger pipeline that is being developped by the lab. The whole will be published soon.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3
* BioPython library
* Tkinter

## Setup
 
The open_aln function is a text oriented function and therefore only works with a very specific NGS text file output
pattern which you can find in images and in the function's description. It can easily be adapted.
